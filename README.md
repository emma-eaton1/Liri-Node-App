# Liri-Node-App
> LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data music, venue, and movie data.\
> The user will open the terminal and type "node liri.js" and then the user will be asked which category they would like to search.\

*concert-this* will search using the Bands in Town Artists Event API to reach for venue name, location and event date.\
*spotify-this-song* will search using the Spotify API for arist(s), song name, and a preview link of the song from spotify.\
*movie-this* will search for a movie using the OMDB to find the movie title, year of release, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie, country of production, language, and plot as well as actors of the movie.\
*do-what-it-says* will use the text from random.txt to call one of LIRI's other commands.
